# Abstract
o address the challenges of imbalanced multi-class datasets
typically used for rare event detection in critical cyber-
physical systems, we propose an optimal, efficient, and adapt-
able mixed integer programming (MIP) ensemble weighting
scheme. Our approach leverages the diverse capabilities of
the classifier ensemble on a granular per class basis, while
optimizing the weights of classifier-class pairs using elas-
tic net regularization for improved robustness and general-
ization. Additionally, it seamlessly and optimally selects a
predefined number of classifiers from a given set. We eval-
uate and compare our MIP-based method against six well-
established weighting schemes, using representative datasets
and suitable metrics, under various ensemble sizes. The ex-
perimental results reveal that MIP outperforms all existing
approaches, achieving an improvement in balanced accuracy
ranging from 0.99% to 7.31%, with an overall average of
4.53% across all datasets and ensemble sizes. Furthermore,
it attains an overall average increase of 4.63%, 4.60%, and
4.61% in macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-score, re-
spectively, while maintaining computational efficiency.
